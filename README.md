# homebrew-phpbrew

B
Homebrew formulas for my personal PHP development.

## Setup

Tap

```bash
$ brew tap markwu/homebrew-php
```

Currently, I only support [phpbrew](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew) and [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
$ brew install phpbrew
$ brew install composer
```

It supports phpbrew & composer's `self-update`, you can update them by

```bash
$ phpbrew self-update
$ composer self-update
```

That's all.
